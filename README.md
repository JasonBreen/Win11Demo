# Win11Demo

Win11Demo is a minimal Win32 and OpenGL 2.1 demo that renders a fragment shader and supports live reloading.

## Features
- **OpenGL shader demo** – `intro.cpp` sets up an OpenGL window and draws a fullscreen quad. The program can reload `shader.frag` at runtime and responds to keyboard and mouse input.
- **Hot reload and controls** – Press `Esc` to exit, `Alt+Enter` to toggle fullscreen, and `R` to trigger a shader reload. The file watcher also reloads the shader whenever `shader.frag` changes on disk.
- **Tunnel fragment shader** – `shader.frag` provides a simple animated tunnel effect that uses time, resolution and mouse uniforms.
- **Visual Studio project** – `Win11Demo.sln` contains a standard Win32 project generated by Visual Studio, useful as a starting point for experimenting with Windows 11 APIs.

## Building
1. Open a **Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio**.
2. Run `build.bat` to compile `intro.cpp` into `intro.exe` using `cl` and the required system libraries.
   ```
   build.bat
   ```
3. Alternatively, open `Win11Demo.sln` in Visual Studio and build the solution.

## Running
1. Execute `intro.exe`.
2. Edit `shader.frag` and save the file to see the demo update live.
